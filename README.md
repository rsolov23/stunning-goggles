You can follow [this guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) to setup your environment.

Just make sure that you initialize your project like so:

```

## For you to do
For personalizing this template, here's a list of things you should do.

- [ ] Copy `.env.sample` to `.env` (btw, `BASE_URL` doesn't need to be in the `.env`, it's only for the example)
- [ ] Update the splash screens on both platforms (`android/app/src/main/res/layout/launch_screen.xml` for Android and `ios/<APP_NAME>/LaunchScreen.storyboard` for iOS)
- [ ] Change the app icons on both platforms
- [ ] Maybe rename the app id from `com.<APP_NAME>` to whatever you like
  - `android/app/_BUCK`
  - `android/app/build.gradle`
  - `android/app/build/generated/source/buildConfig/debug/com/<APP_NAME>/BuildConfig.java`
  - `android/app/src/debug/java/com/<APP_NAME>/ReactNativeFlipper.java`
  - `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`
  - `android/app/src/main/java/com/<APP_NAME>/MainActivity.java`
  - `android/app/src/main/java/APP_NAME>/MainApplication.java`
  - The file structure in `android/app/src/main/java` to reflect you app id. e.g. `com.tb.app` -> `android/app/src/main/java/com/tb/app/...`
- [ ] Change the app itself!
